Really glad to join the team at Korem and to build world-class geospatial apps!

Leaving Cossette was really hard but was also something I felt I needed to do personally. After 10 years, I had the simple urge to try something new. Cossette's projects were always very diversified, but I could rarely get in-depth before having to move on to the next subject. That feeling of going at 120kmh and seeing a ton of landscape in such a short amount of time is awesome at first, but comes a time when you really just want to start getting to know a place a little better.

For me, that's geospatial. I've always been attracted to maps for some reason. I did a lot of that at Cossette, and I did some more in my spare time with my buddies as well. There's something really great about visualizing data on a map. It makes boring data come to life. It's a common language for all and I feel it helps understanding our world a little better.
