<p>In an effort to use the command line a little more and synchronize my configuration files across multiple environments, I created a <a href="https://github.com/louisroy/dotfiles">new repo for my dotfiles</a>. It&rsquo;s pretty limited since I&rsquo;m kinda new to this but it&rsquo;ll get better with time. I&rsquo;ll probably dive into GitHub&rsquo;s <a href="http://dotfiles.github.io/">guide on dotfiles</a> in the near future to get inspired and see what kind of power I can unleash from the CL.</p>
