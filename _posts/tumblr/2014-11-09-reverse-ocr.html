<a href="http://reverseocr.tumblr.com/">Reverse OCR</a><br/><p>Interesting experiment. This is a bot that, after being given a random word, starts drawing semi-random lines until an image-to-text software guesses the right word. The results are pretty cool, they look like a mix between a child and mechanical robot trying to write for the first time.</p>
