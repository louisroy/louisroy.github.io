<p>As soon as I heard the Dillinger Escape Plan was headlining this year&rsquo;s Summer Slaughter Tour, I knew I was in for a good show. And boy did they deliver. It was my 6th time seeing them this Friday at the Métropolis in Montréal and the band, as always, lived up to their hype. Proclaimed as the <a href="http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2013/05/the_five_most_insane_bands_to.php?page=2">most insane band to see live</a> by the Houston Press, the Dillinger Escape Plan is one of the few bands I would recommend live if you don&rsquo;t know (or even like) their music. Their energy and enthusiasm are contagious and no one in the audience is left unmoved (or unharmed, depending on where you&rsquo;re standing).</p>
<p>In short : catch them live if you can.</p>
