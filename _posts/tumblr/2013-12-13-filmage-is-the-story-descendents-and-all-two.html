<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/43951523?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="100%" height="225" frameborder="0" title="FILMAGE Teaser 2" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><p><a href="http://www.filmagemovie.com/">Filmage</a> is the story Descendents and All, two tightly linked and influential pop-punk bands of the 80s/90s. I&rsquo;m a sucker for music documentaries, so I got really interested when I heard there would be a screening at <a href="http://www.le-cercle.ca">Le Cercle</a> on December 11th. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refused_Are_Fucking_Dead">Refused Are Fucking Dead</a> was pretty much my only experience in terms of punk rock documentary so I came in with a lot of expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. Filmage is at the opposite spectrum of Kristofer Steen&rsquo;s film : it&rsquo;s funny, upbeat and, most importantly, it&rsquo;s positive. Even though they battled with death, breakups, illness, these guys never doubted themselves and kept going. After thirty years of being underdogs, Descendents/All are just starting to get some recognition and I must say it&rsquo;s well deserved.</p>
