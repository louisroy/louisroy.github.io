<p>It was <a href="http://www.darktranquillity.com/">Dark Tranquillity</a>&rsquo;s turn to visit Quebec City this winter at Le Dagobert last Thursday. Even though I haven&rsquo;t dug their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_%28album%29">last album</a> that much, from past experiences, I had high hopes for this show. Mikael Stanne is still an incredibly energetic frontman and the band is as tight as ever (albeit they don&rsquo;t have a bass player anymore). Unfortunately, for my taste, some crucial songs we&rsquo;re missing from the <a href="http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/dark-tranquillity/2014/les-foufounes-electriques-montreal-qc-canada-3bc53004.html">setlist</a> (particularly from the Character era). I am also puzzled as to why any band would want to book Le Dagobert. The sound was excellent but the configuration of this venue with the three bars splitting everyone apart is definitely not adequate for a metal band. Anywho, I still had a good time and I&rsquo;ll still be there when DT will be back in town.</p>
