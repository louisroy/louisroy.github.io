<p>Last Friday, I reconnected with improv with the <a href="http://lepunchclub.com/">Punch Club</a> at l'Agit√©e right here in Quebec City. Back in the days, I used to watch every LNI show I could on TV but somehow I ended up forgetting how funny and impressive these matches were. The only rule of the Punch Club is that there is no rule : if you suck or don&rsquo;t follow the themes, only the audience can judge you through their votes. The teams also get to interrupt, harass and distract their opponents during the scenes which brings a whole new dimension to the game. Highly recommended if you&rsquo;re in for a good laugh.</p>
