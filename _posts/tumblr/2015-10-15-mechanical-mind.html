<p>I recently swapped my Windows laptop for a brand new Macbook Pro. With the switch, I had to let go of my trusty <a href="https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/6gv2">SteelSeries 6GV2</a> mechanical keyboard because the left command key is hard-wired as a function key and can’t be remapped programmatically, which wasn’t such a big deal on Windows, but makes it pretty much impossible to do any kind of work under OSX.</p><p>So I figured I’d just use a brand new, sleek <a href="http://www.apple.com/magic-accessories/">Mac keyboard</a> and I’d adapt, just like normal humans do. Well I was wrong. Using this keyboard for the past weeks has been a fucking torture and I finally decided I wanted my mechanical friend back.</p><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="595" class="tmblr-full"><img data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="595" src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/ab8f8901a72479c8b917e5740da06aee/tumblr_inline_nw9fl91SbE1s4fqmc_540.jpg"/></figure><p>I did a little bit of research and finally came across <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=11562.msg1759586#msg1759586">this forum post</a> which explains that you simply have to open up the keyboard, identify the key on the board and solder two wires from this key to the key you want it to act like. So I simply soldered it to the right Windows key and voilà : it now acts like a normal command key.</p><p>The loud thumping and clacking of my keyboard is now back, much to the chagrin of my fellow colleagues.<br/></p>
