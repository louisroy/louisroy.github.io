<p>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with Raspberry Pis for the last couple of months now. I have two ongoing projects and these little things never cease to amaze me.</p>

<p>My first idea was to build a micro Super Nintendo to carry around. A lot of people have had the same idea in the last years and so I managed to get it working without too much problems. <a href="http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/">RetroPie</a>, <a href="http://aloshi.com/emulationstation">EmulationStation</a> and the overall <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> community made it all very easy to get it up running. I ended up 3D-printing <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:151866">a case I found on Thingiverse</a> (it&rsquo;s not a SNES, but it&rsquo;ll do the job). This Pi has a 64GB SD card which can pack a lot a whole lot of ROMs (all legal, of couse). Surprisingly, I&rsquo;ve been able to run PS1 games without too much hassle (Twisted Metal, baby!!). N64 games have been challenging though, hope I can fix that in the next few weeks.Â </p>

<p>The other thing I&rsquo;m working on is a video streaming computer. With the camera module attached, this Pi&rsquo;s job is to encode a video feed then transfer it to a remote server who then streams the data to users. We&rsquo;re currently using it to monitor our 3D printer and make sure it doesn&rsquo;t do anything crazy overnight. I have followed this <a href="http://phoboslab.org/log/2013/09/html5-live-video-streaming-via-websockets">quick tutorial</a> to make it work and I&rsquo;m currently releasing <a href="https://github.com/cossette/shutt">some code</a> based on what I learned in the last few weeks.</p>
