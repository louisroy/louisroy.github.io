<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/10/programming-is-hard-lets-go-shopping.html">Programming Is Hard, Let's Go Shopping!</a><br/><p>This is an old article by Jeff Atwood I came across while reading Hacker News. I really, really, really liked Joel Splosky&rsquo;s quote :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a core business function &ndash; do it yourself, no matter what.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having spent a good chunk of the last weeks building a Git server/deployment platform for my team at work, I felt somewhat reassured about my decision. While this is not what I could call a &ldquo;core business function&rdquo;, I could have just gone with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://gitlab.org/">GItLab</a> or any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_software_hosting_facilities">pre-packaged solution</a> out there. But I felt I needed to get the grasp of what was going on behind the scenes in order to provide support for my team, customize our workflow and be as productive as ever.</p>
