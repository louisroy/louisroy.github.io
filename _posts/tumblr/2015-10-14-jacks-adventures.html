<a href="http://jack.ventures/">Jack's Adventures</a><br/><p>While I was browsing GitHub, I came across this <a href="https://github.com/Jack000/Expose">nifty little static site generator</a>, and coincidentally ended up on <a href="http://jack.ventures/">it’s creator’s website</a>, which is incredibly well done. The photos &amp; videos are mesmerizing, the descriptions are short but very descriptive, and everything’s so damn fluid. I also like how the navbar on the left changes color depending on the dominant color of the picture that’s displayed. Definitely makes me want to pack my stuff and travel the world.<br/></p>
