<p>We released a pretty cool project just before the holidays at Cossette. We were given the chance to re-imagine and build a new image for <a href="http://www.lgs.com">LGS</a>, a local IT consultant firm owned by IBM. Our mandate was to cover pretty much everything : website, business cards, employee pictures and last but not least, their new logo.</p>
<p>I kind of stumbled upon the project when I overheard the creative team trying to create something new : something that would be very design oriented, but would also have deep roots in technology. Some examples of &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; logos were brought up, like the <a href="http://www.eroonkang.com/projects/MIT-Media-Lab-Identity/">MIT Media Lab</a>, and <a href="http://www.neue.no/nordkyn/">Nordkyn</a>. I jumped in and we tried a bunch of stuff : pixel art, Voronoi diagrams, various geometric shapes, etc. We finally stuck with the octagon, a metaphor for the 8-bit era, and went from there.</p>

<p>Through trial and error, we pushed our original idea further and ended up creating a logo that was also a language for LGS. Each segment inside the octagon is actually a bit of information. Their new logo can be duplicated and customized for anything they want and can actually store data, giving a real meaning to each and every one of them. One way to store such information, is to generate custom logos for the employees with their name encrypted in their respective signatures.</p>

<p>These signatures are not only unique, but they live through time as well. By using the employees&rsquo; timesheets (and some elbow grease), we were able to group all of LGS&rsquo; clients into 8 different sectors (aerospace, transports, health, environment, etc.). Each of these sectors is associated with a specific color and each employees has 2 dominant sectors (the ones they are working in right now). Like in all consulting firms, employees shift their focus from one client to the other once their projects are completed. This means the employee&rsquo;s logo colors also changes as he or she evolves in the company.</p>

<p>In the end, the underlying goal of this rebrand was to put the light on LGS&rsquo; employees, who are the lifeblood of the company. With these new shiny logos, we were able to say : here&rsquo;s John Doe, he&rsquo;s unique, but he&rsquo;s also part of a bigger whole, LGS.</p>
<p>This has been a really cool and challenging project to work on. I used Processing from start to finish and, having no experience at all with the technology, I must say I was incredibly impressed by the ease of use of the language and the help I found online. The IDE sucks but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>Most importantly, this really has been a team effort by two groups with complete opposite skill sets. We usually joke around saying devs and creatives can&rsquo;t really work together, but we made it happen on this project. And I think (and hope) we may see technology a lot more involved in the design/branding process of our future projects.</p>
