<p>LOST has always been one of my favorite TV shows. Even though you can argue some aspects of it were disappointing (including the ending), I feel it was the most entertaining, clever and well-researched series in recent years. The music makes no exception. I&rsquo;ve been exposed to a plethora of awesome retro artists through the show and I decided some time ago I wanted more of it. And I wanted them in vinyl format because, you know, I wanna do it in style!</p>
<p>So I got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Your_Own_Kind_of_Music_%28Cass_Elliot_album%29">Mama Cass&rsquo; Make Your Own Kind Of Music</a>, then I was given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanadu_%28soundtrack%29">Xanadu&rsquo;s soundtrack</a> and finally I found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_%28album%29">Petula Clark&rsquo;s Downtown</a> this weekend in Montr√©al.</p>

<p>Next time I get on a record store <em>razzia</em>, Willie Nelson, Patsy Cline and Glenn Miller will definitively be on my list.</p>
