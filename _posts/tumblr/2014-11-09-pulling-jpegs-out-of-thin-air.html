<a href="http://lcamtuf.blogspot.ca/2014/11/pulling-jpegs-out-of-thin-air.html">Pulling JPEGs out of thin air</a><br/><p>Another sweet experiment. Using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing">fuzzer</a>, this guy creates JPEGs out of nothing. This is the first time I hear about fuzz testing. I&rsquo;d like to see more of these experiments with different file types.</p>
