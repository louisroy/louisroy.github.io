<a href="http://daemon.co.za/2014/03/from-trenches-js-cdn-point-of-failure/">CDN-hosted JavaScript Represents an Additional Point of Failure</a><br/><p>With the recent launch of <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/03/jsdelivr-the-advanced-open-source-public-cdn/">jsDelivr</a>, I came across a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7428803">good discussion</a> on Hacker News. With everything seemingly going towards CDN-hosted assets these days, Andrian Rossouw had some valid concerns about that recent trend. Most notably, his example about living behind the Great Firewall of China and not being to properly load a website really struck a chord. That&rsquo;s the kind of problem that is hard to track down and that can have disastrous effects on the long term. I still think CDN-hosted libraries are great for rapid prototyping and for very small projects, but you do have to be careful and think twice before using that kind of code on larger projects.</p>
