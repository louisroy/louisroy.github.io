<p>It&rsquo;s with sunburns and blisters that I&rsquo;m coming back from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=isle+verte&amp;data=!1m4!1m3!1d36963!2d-69.4079859!3d48.0335878!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d22583679!2d-95.677068!3d37.0625!3m2!1i1366!2i665!4f13.1">l'Isle Verte</a> where a bunch of friends and I embarked on the most biblical journey we ever had : crossing the St-Lawrence river&hellip; on foot. Well, not the whole river, obviously, but a small chunk of it that was partially walkable at low tide. We joined some 300 people who all did <a href="http://labouette.com/">le sentier de la Bouette</a>, an annual event that promotes the small island that is Isle Verte.</p>
<p>Needless to say this was pretty amazing. Not only the trek itself but the island as well which had some of the best sceneries I&rsquo;ve seen in a while and the nicest people. While visiting the island, we stumbled across a bunch of amateur radio operators who we&rsquo;re competing on a worldwide contest called <a href="http://www.rsgbiota.org/">Islands on the Air</a>. They had 48 hours to contact as much islands as they could across the globe using radio waves, usually only giving their coordinates and moving to another frequency at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a great weekend. I&rsquo;ll post pictures as soon as I develop my film.</p>
