<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_my9qtfhSX71saopu3o1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>Again. So late. Much delay.</p>
<p>We shipped our Christmas gifts for our clients back in December. These are 3D printed Arduino clocks. <a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/mfaRjGgr38SwWaylidKyYEw">jesuismarjorie</a> and I designed, programmed, soldered, glued, stained and built almost everything in-house at Cossette. More info to come the <a href="http://cossette.github.io/K7OCK/">projectâ€™s website</a>.</p>
