She shot everything with Instagram during our trip to New Mexico. It&rsquo;s ah-mah-zing! &lt;3</p>
<p>The song is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/toddandthefox/amanda">Amanda</a> by <a href="http://toddandthefox.com/">Todd and the Fox</a>. We had a chance to catch a glimpse of their show at Marble Brewery in Albuquerque and they were kind enough to let her use the tune for the video.</p>
