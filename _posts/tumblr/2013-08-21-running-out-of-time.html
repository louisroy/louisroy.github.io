<p>What a weird band Iceage is. These Danish dudes look like they just got out of high school; they&rsquo;ve been associated with neo-nazism ever since I heard from them; their two albums have been unanimously praised by critics worldwide; but most importantly, they&rsquo;ve been producing some of most menacing and uncomfortable punk music of the new millennium.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see they can put on a good show, because they totally let me down when I saw them at Il Motore in Montreal back in July of 2012. The singer was a wreck and the rest of the guys just couldn&rsquo;t get a song right. But then again, they&rsquo;re pretty chaotic : that could&rsquo;ve been exactly what they wanted. I just might give them a second chance, cause they&rsquo;re <strong>that</strong> good.</p>
