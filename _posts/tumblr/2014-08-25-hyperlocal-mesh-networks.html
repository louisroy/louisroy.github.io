<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/nyregion/red-hooks-cutting-edge-wireless-network.html">Hyperlocal Mesh Networks</a><br/><p>Great article by the NY Times about how communities organize themselves when no one seems to care about them. I expect to see more and more of these local networks over time.</p>
<p>This quote stood out for me :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joshua Breitbart, a senior fellow at New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute, which created the software that helps the Red Hook mesh operate, said digital culture was too focused on the global, as opposed to the local. “The general narrative of Silicon Valley is, build an app and change the world,” Mr. Breitbart said. “There should be room to say, ‘<strong>Build an app and change my neighborhood.</strong>’ ”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this the dawn of hyperlocal software development?</p>
