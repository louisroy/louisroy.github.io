<a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/bryce-salvador-devils-retirement/">'Til It's Gone</a><br/><p>The Player’s Tribune have done an amazing job at giving hockey players a tribune (duh) for the last year or so. The storytelling is spot on and each story is personal, captivating and gives us a good sense of what being a pro athlete really is.</p><p>For some reason, Bryce Salvador’s story stood out for me. I really rooted for the Devils back in 2012 when they went all in for their Stanley Cup run. They were the underdogs, with a couple of really exciting players, and some Cinderella stories. Unfortunately, they fell short and their team went way downhill after that. Salvador had an awesome playoff run that year and it’s all the more impressive when you read what he had to go through to get back to this level after his injury.<br/></p>
