<p>I&rsquo;m diving head first into Ruby by writing my own gem : <a href="https://github.com/louisroy/sulu">Sulu</a>. This project will be an adaptation of my previously released <a href="http://sulu.louisroy.net/">website with the same name</a>. Sulu was originally built to help me find tabs while I was playing guitar. Since it&rsquo;s connected to Last.fm, I can start pretty much any song in my music library and Sulu will find the best tab according to what&rsquo;s currently playing. My plan is to write the gem with the same functionalities and then rebuild the website around it.</p>
