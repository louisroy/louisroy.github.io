<p>Pretty late on this one, but whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a huge metal fan since my teen years. I&rsquo;ve diversified my taste a whole lot since then but I still have a sweet spot for distortion, screams and blastbeats. So anyway, Sherbrooke&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.gorguts.com/">Gorguts</a> visited my hometown last December. They&rsquo;ve been making the headlines lately with their latest album, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colored_Sands">Colored Sands</a>, making year-end top 10 lists everywhere. This is an awesome comeback for frontman Luc Lemay who had postponed the project for a long time following the death of drummer Steve MadDonald.</p>
<p>They showed up around 11pm, pounding their way through &ldquo;<a href="http://gorguts.bandcamp.com/track/le-toit-du-monde">Le Toit du Monde</a>&rdquo; and ended up playing the entire Colored Sands album. The aggressive yet groovy &ldquo;<a href="http://gorguts.bandcamp.com/track/enemies-of-compassion">Enemies of Compassion</a>&rdquo; got my head bouncing up and down as were the show&rsquo;s closer classics &ldquo;Inverted&rdquo; and &ldquo;Obscura&rdquo;. They could have benefited from a better venue and, perhaps consequently, from better sound, but Luc Lemay and his crew delivered the goods that night.</p>
<p>Props to my buddies in <a href="http://laceratedenemyrecords.bandcamp.com/album/unbreakable-hatred-total-chaos">Unbreakable Hatred</a> who opened the show and delivered a good dose of crushing riffs.</p>
