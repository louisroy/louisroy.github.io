<p>So it&rsquo;s been about two months now since I&rsquo;ve started playing bass with Albatros. I figured it might be useful for the band to have <a href="http://www.albatrosqc.com/">a website</a>. I feel most new bands are usually scattered all across the Web (Facebook, Bandcamp, MySpace, whatever) and sometimes forget it&rsquo;s good to have a centralized presence somewhere. This was my goal with this website : minimalistic and straight to the point.Â </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s particular about this page? Really not that much except it was the first time I was trying <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> as a real hosting solution. Pretty easy to set up : I created a new <a href="https://github.com/albatrosqc">organization</a> for the band, created a <a href="https://github.com/albatrosqc/albatrosqc.github.io">new project</a> following the naming scheme, pointed our domain to GitHub servers and added the CNAME file. Everything was up and running after a few hours and we&rsquo;re now pushing and pulling our way through last minute tour dates changes!</p>
