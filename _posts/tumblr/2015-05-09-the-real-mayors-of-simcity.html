five mayoral candidates competed against each other in the 
then-brand-new game. The experiment was set up by Joseph Braude, a 
freelancer for the Providence Journal who was only 15 years old
 at the time. Little did Lederberg know that the article Braude would 
write, which included details about her simulated incompetence, would 
hurt her with real voters.
