<p>I&rsquo;ve just created <a href="https://github.com/cossette">my first organization</a> on GitHub for the place I work for. So far, so good! We have a couple of projects we want to open-source so I expect the account to fill up quite a bit in the next few weeks. GH makes it really easy to transfer repos from an account to another and I feel like I&rsquo;ll be able to manage my team and everyone&rsquo;s pull requests with no hassle. #feelsgoodman</p>
