<p>Found this short documentary while browsing the <a href="http://watson2016.com">Watson for President</a> campaign. This experiment was done 5 years ago, so the project must have made huge leaps since then. It makes wonder how capable Watson would be at making presidential decisions. Something tells me this would end up in a Skynet/Global apocalypse type of thing.<br></p>
