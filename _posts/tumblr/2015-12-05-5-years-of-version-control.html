<p>It’s been 5 years since we implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control</a> on all of our projects at <a href="http://www.cossette.com">Cossette</a>. We were way late to the party on this one but this wasn’t something that was really crucial at the time as we were a rather small team with rather small projects. We first started with <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> in 2010 and finally switched over to <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> in 2013.<br/></p><p>I recently needed to identify which of our 200+ projects were still active or at least updated once in a while. I figured my best course of action was to review our Git logs and figure out which projects had received at least one update in the last 3 months.</p><p>When I started working with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log">git-log</a> things got a bit outta hand : I realized we had gathered a massive amount of data while working on our daily projects. Furthermore, there were some really cool learnings to draw from that like finding what period of the year we’re usually the most swamped, or what’s the biggest project we’ve ever delivered in the shortest amount of time, or figuring out our developers’ commit habits.</p><figure data-orig-width="2496" data-orig-height="398" class="tmblr-full"><img data-orig-width="2496" data-orig-height="398" src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/4bd8afd8774a9d7fb723c55065cd70e5/tumblr_inline_nywdr7l4zR1s4fqmc_540.png"/></figure><p>I imported all the logs into a MySQL database to facilitate the queries I was about to do. I then used Google Charts to display the results. Some things I found out we’re really interesting :</p><ul><li>Springs are busy : no doubt about it, always the craziest part of the year;</li><li>Afternoon is where it’s at : I was kinda surprised about this one, but it looks like we do most of our work in the afternoon. I feel like I’m usually most productive in the morning, but the end of day last minute requests probably have something to do with this;</li><li>Growth : each year that passes has more commits to it than the last one (with the exception of 2013, which was unusually crazy-busy). To me, that’s excellent news : we’ve been hiring developers and keeping them busy;</li><li>Fast projects : our “<a href="http://pride.snclavalin.com/">Proud to build what matters</a>” website for SNC-Lavalin this year was the fastest biggest project we’ve ever delivered. A simply division of number of commits per active work days help me reached that conclusion. Kinda skewed, but still indicative of how effective we were with this particular project;<br/></li></ul><p>All in all, most of the statistics I gathered were only proof of things we already assumed. But it’s always nice to put these thoughts into numbers.<br/></p>
