<p>A week and half of fun in New Mexico, in no particular order :</p>
<ul><li>visited a couple of Breaking Bad shooting locations;</li>
<li>watched my first rodeo show;</li>
<li>rode my first mechanical bull (and sucked badly at it);</li>
<li>met some seriously brilliant people;</li>
<li>drank some of the best IPAs I had in a while;</li>
<li>got to visit Roswell and it&rsquo;s funny/mockable UFO museum;</li>
<li>hiked a little bit;</li>
<li>bathed in a hot spring;</li>
<li>saw a lynx</li>
</ul><p>In short, this was somewhat unexpected to me, but New Mexico really is aptly named &ldquo;Land of Enchantment&rdquo;. Can&rsquo;t wait to go back. I&rsquo;ll post pictures soon.</p>
