<p>Time flies. It&rsquo;s already been two weeks since I came back from Albatros&rsquo; Canadian tour. Still can&rsquo;t believe how lucky I was to play with such great bands every night and how awesome/helpful everyone has been to us during those two weeks. Some highlights, in no particular order :</p>
<ul><li>did an epic 18 hour drive through the night from Kenora to Sudbury;</li>
<li>met the coolest dudes in the <a href="http://www.kenora.ca/premier-boating/premier-boating-destination.aspx">Premier Boating Destination</a>, <a href="http://1971canada.bandcamp.com/">1971</a>;</li>
<li>broke my phone playing rip-someone&rsquo;s-head-off-with-a-football;</li>
<li>totally unexpected, but <a href="https://veneers.bandcamp.com">Veneers</a> blew my mind in Toronto, they sound <em>really</em> good;</li>
<li>started and ended the tour with our soul mates in <a href="http://worstgift.bandcamp.com/">Worst Gift</a>;</li>
<li>had some fun with Johnny the Amish in Kelowna (not, what a dork);</li>
<li>did not abide to my self-imposed cigarette quota;</li>
<li>froze my fucking ass off camping in the Rockies;</li>
<li>had breakfast, like, all the time;</li>
<li>probably ate too much A&amp;W;</li>
<li>saw a bandmate puke in a plastic cookie box while driving back to Quebec;</li>
<li>Winnipeg is fucking weird.</li>
</ul><p>Will post some pics as soon as I get a hold of them.</p>
