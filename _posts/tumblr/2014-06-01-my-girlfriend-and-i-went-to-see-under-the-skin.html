I went to bed completely puzzled by this visually striking and very creepy movie, as if there was something I missed in all this.</p>
<p>So this morning I&rsquo;m looking for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/15/scarlett-johansson-under-skin-extraterrestrial">clues</a> all over the Internet. I feel like there&rsquo;s more to this movie than the simple &ldquo;alien hottie abducts male all over Scotland&rdquo; synopsis. And there most certainly is, I&rsquo;m not just there yet.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not here to spoil anything. This is the kind of artsy flick I would have brushed aside rather quickly normally. But maybe I&rsquo;m changing. Maybe this is a good movie.</p>
