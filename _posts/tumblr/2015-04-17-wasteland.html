<p>70 hours. That’s what I spent playing <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/240760/?snr=1_5_9__300">Wasteland 2</a> these past few weeks. I hadn’t been hooked to a game like that for a long, long time, probably since Just Cause 2. <br/></p><p>Two years ago, when I backed <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2">Wasteland 2 on Kickstarter</a>, I kind of expected I’d have to free up some/a lot of time to play. I never tried the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_%28video_game%29">Wasteland</a>,
 an old-school post-apocalyptic RPG, but I knew very well the first two 
installments of the Fallout series, a spiritual successor to the 
original Wasteland game. Back when I was a kid, I used to rent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2">Fallout 2</a>
 every weekend at my local video store and played the shit out of it. 
And this definitely wasn’t a kid’s game : drugs, violence, sex, you name
 it. It had sub-par graphics (which probably explains why I could rent 
it at a young age) but the storytelling, the writing and the acting was 
so spot-on that I was immediately drawn to it.</p><p>So it goes without 
saying that I instantly relived those glorious days when I first fired 
up Wasteland 2 : the desert, the radiation, the energy weapons, the 
factions, everything is there expect Fallout’s 1950s vibe (which, from 
what I understand, never was a part of the Wasteland universe anyway). 
The learning curve was kind of steep for my taste and I got really 
frustrated for the first few hours. But once I mastered my characters 
strengths and weaknesses and understood combat tactics, the game got fun
 really quick.</p><p>This was my first experience with Kickstarter and 
I’m really glad I helped fund this game. This is why Kickstarter exists :
 projects that wouldn’t be funded otherwise because they’re deemed too 
risky. Wasteland 2 isn’t a “beautiful” game, it’s not “action-packed” or
 “massively multiplayer”, but it fits within a particular niche : people
that have grown up with slow-paced, turn-based games with lots of rich 
dialogues. It’s not cool, it’s not trendy, but there will always be a 
market for that.<br/></p><p>Counter-culture through crowd-funding is a beautiful thing.<br/></p>
