<p>Yesterday night, I had the privilege of listening to some new songs from my favorite local band, <a href="http://albatrosqc.bandcamp.com/">Albatros</a>, at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/leknockoutlautredisquaire">Le Knock-Out</a>. This was a great sneak peek of their upcoming show on December 13. The real highlight of night for me though was the headliners, <a href="http://native.bandcamp.com/">Native</a> from Indiana. I had heard little from them before the show and they left me floored. The way went from soft interludes to walls of noise impressed me immensely and the energy they bring on stage is raw and indisputable.</p>
