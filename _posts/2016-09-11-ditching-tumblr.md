After dumping Dreamhost, I'm finally moving off Tumblr for a leaner, more flexible website hosted on GitHub Pages with Jekyll.

I was initially tempted by Tumblr for its ease of use, the ability to post content through their mobile app and the general community surrounding.

A couple years passed and I realized I'm not using the community features at all, barely using the mobile app and found out that theming Tumblr is a kind of a pain in the ass. Peak has really helped with that though.
